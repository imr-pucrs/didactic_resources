The `.npy` format means that that the data has been saved in a native Numpy matrix format, instead of a text (ASCII) format like a csv-file. These matrices can be read directly into your program by using the load command. After loading, matrices of the correct dimensions and values will appear in your program's memory.\n",

    "There are 5000 training examples in `data_nn.npy`, where each training example is a 20 pixel by 20 pixel grayscale image of the digit. Each pixel is represented by a floating point number indicating the grayscale intensity at that location. The 20 by 20 grid of pixels is \"unrolled\" into a 400-dimensional vector. Each of these training examples becomes a single row in our data matrix `X`. This gives us a 5000 by 400 matrix `X` where every row is a training example for a handwritten digit image.\n",
